## Theme

If you dont consider UX a first class citizen then the users will just cimcumvent your design the first chance they get.

## Major problems that affect the UX of a secure infrastructure design:

- auth and authorization issues (ssh keys, passwords)
- network traversal (firewall rules, security groups)
- the designer making things so secure that the user is incumbered to do anything
- users not effectively communiczting their needs during the design phase
- designer and developers not understanding the needs of the users
